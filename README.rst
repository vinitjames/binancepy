Fetching Market Data
--------------------

To fetch market data with binance market data endpoints both PublicClient and AuthenticatedClient can be used. PublicClient can be used without without an API key.

.. code-block:: python

    from binance.client import PublicClient
   
    # creating a public client with default request params
    client = PublicClient()
    
    #getting server time
    result = client.get_server_time()
    
    # getting exchange info
    ex_info = client.get_exchange_info()

    # getting exchange info
    sym_info = client.get_symbol_info(symbol='ETHEUR')
    
    #getting price_ticker if symbol not included value for all symbols are returned
    price_ticker = client.get_price_ticker(symbol='ETHEUR')

    #getting orderbook ticker if symbol not included value for all symbols are returned
    orderbook_ticker = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol='ETHEUR')
    
    #getting orderbook for a symbol        
    orderbook = client.get_order_book(symbol='ETHEUR', limit = 10)
	
    #getting average price, for the specified symbol
    avg_price = client.get_avg_price('ETHEUR')
 
    #getting 24hr price ticker, if symbol not included value for all symbols are returned
    _24_hr_ticker = client.get_24hr_ticker('ETHEUR')
	
    #getting recent trades for a symbol    
    recent_trades = client.get_recent_trades('ETHEUR', limit=5)
				
    #getting historical klines/candelstick for a symbol,         
    klines = client.get_historical_klines(symbol = 'ETHUSDT',
                                          interval = client.KLINE_INTERVAL.ONEDAY,
                                          startTime = '2/12/2018',
                                          endTime = '12/12/2019')


Trading and Getting Account/Wallet Info with API keys  
-----------------------------------------------------
To use trading(Spot, Margin, Future) and wallet endpoints a binance account create a binance account.  
`Register an account with Binance <https://www.binance.com/register.html?ref=10099792>`_.


`Generate an API Key <https://www.binance.com/userCenter/createApi.html>`_ and assign relevant permissions.

.. code-block:: python

    from binance.client import AuthenticatedClient
   
    client = AuthenticatedClient(api_key, api_secret)

    # get market depth
    depth = client.get_order_book(symbol='BNBBTC')
   
   # place a test market buy order, to place an actual order use the create_order function
   order = client.create_test_order(
				symbol='BNBBTC',
				side=Client.SIDE_BUY,
				type=Client.ORDER_TYPE_MARKET,
				quantity=100)

   # get all symbol prices
   prices = client.get_all_tickers()

   # withdraw 100 ETH
   # check docs for assumptions around withdrawals
   from binance.exceptions import BinanceAPIError, BinanceWithdrawError

   try:
     result = client.withdraw(
				asset='ETH',
				address='<eth_address>',
				amount=100)
	 except BinanceAPIException as e:
			print(e)
			
	 except BinanceWithdrawException as e:
            print(e)
	 else:
		print("Success")

	 # fetch list of withdrawals
	 withdraws = client.get_withdraw_history()

	 # fetch list of ETH withdrawals
	 eth_withdraws = client.get_withdraw_history(asset='ETH')

	 # get a deposit address for BTC
	 address = client.get_deposit_address(asset='BTC')

	 # start aggregated trade websocket for BNBBTC
	 def process_message(msg):
	     print("message type: {}".format(msg['e']))
		 print(msg)
